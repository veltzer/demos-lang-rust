Producers consumers exercise

Create a program that will launch multiple threads in rust.
N producers and M consumers (they are all threads).
The producers create random numbers in a loop sleeping for 1 mili second after
creating each number. Use "rand::Rng".
The consumers will consume these random numbers and will write then to "/dev/null".

Use https://docs.rs/crossbeam-channel/latest/crossbeam_channel/
to pass messages betwen the producers and the consumers.
