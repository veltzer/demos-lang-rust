Producers consumers exercise

Create a program that will launch multiple threads in rust.
N producers and M consumers.
The producers create random numbers in a loop sleeping for 1 mili second after
creating each number. Use "rand::Rng".
The consumers will consume these random numbers and will write then to "/dev/null".
Use std::sync::mpsc to pass messages between the producers and the consumers.
