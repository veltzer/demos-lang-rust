# Priority Queue Implementation

Implement a priority queue for a task management system with the following requirements:
1. Each task has a priority level (1 = highest priority, 5 = lowest) and a description
2. Tasks should be processed based on their priority (higher priority tasks come out first)
3. Tasks with the same priority should be processed in FIFO order
4. Implement methods to add tasks, get the highest priority task, and list all tasks
