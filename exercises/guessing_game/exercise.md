# Guessing Game

Write a rust app that chooses a random number in the range (0,100).
The user then guess the number.
If the user guessed the number, a congratulatory message is printed
and the game ends.
If the user guessed a smaller/larger number the right message is printed and the user is allowed to guess again.
